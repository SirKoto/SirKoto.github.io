A partition of the vertices is given by the sign of the components of the Fiedler Vector.

A Union-Find algorithm has been implemented to separate the connected clusters and classify them separately.\nThe program also supports computing an optimized cache-oblivious mesh layout, following Yoon et al.1, which optimizes each of the clusters' vertices and sorts the faces of the mesh.

In this field, you usually seek to obtain results that visually behave like real objects, and so it is essential to use the mathematical models that define their behaviour.\n\nIn particular, deformable objects are hard and challenging to simulate, since their behaviour is defined by continuum mechanics. In this category we can find fluids, elastic and plastic materials.\n\nThe fact that the validation in many cases is visual, allows simplifying such mathematical models to gain calculation speed or to decrease the complexity of what would be an engineering simulation.\n\nIn this end-of-degree project we delve into *MPM* (Material Point Method), which is a hybrid method based on particles and meshes, adaptable and efficient enough to perform a wide spectrum of simulations with multiple materials. With this method, we can incorporate the different types of interactions (elastic, plastic and tear) that simulated objects can experience.\n\nBecause this is such a complex topic, even more for the computer science student who has no prior experience in the field, this project aims to be a good introduction to the material simulation field from the point of view of a computer scientist, without assuming previous knowledge of continuum mechanics, numerical methods and simulation techniques, either based on finite element methods (*FEM*) or on the *MPM* itself.\n\n\n","tags":["Simulation"],"title":"Material Point Method (MPM) application to object deformation - Bachelor Thesis","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
